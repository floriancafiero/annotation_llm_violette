# Annotation grid

## Unit of annotation

Annotate one relationship at a time. A relationship is a romantic, erotic, sexual, conjugal, desirous, or strongly ambiguous relation between two characters or groups of characters.

Do not annotate ordinary friendship unless the text strongly romanticizes, eroticizes, scandalizes, pathologizes, or codes it as potentially amorous or sexual.

Each novel may contain zero, one, or several annotated relationships.

## Core principle

The scheme is deliberately modest. The LLM should not decide whether a passage belongs to a sophisticated theoretical category. Instead, it annotates five simpler dimensions: configuration, explicitness, centrality, framing, and outcome. Scholarly interpretation can then be built from combinations of these variables.

## 1. `relation_type`

One label only.

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| `heterosexual` | Relation between a male and a female character: romantic, conjugal, sexual, adulterous, or desirous. |
| `female_female` | Relation between two characters identified as female: romantic, conjugal, sexual, adulterous, or desirous. |
| `male_male` |  Relation between two characters identified as male: romantic, conjugal, sexual, adulterous, or desirous.  |
| `same_sex_ambiguous` | Strong same-sex intimacy, fascination, jealousy, reputation, household, or devotion, but the text does not make romance/sexuality clear enough. Use this instead of overcoding friendship as queer romance. |
| `mixed_triangle` | A triangular or multi-person configuration mixing heterosexual and same-sex desire. |
| `unclear` | A relation is present, but its gendered configuration cannot be reliably determined. |

## 2. `explicitness`

One label only.

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| `explicit` | The text names, stages, or directly confesses love, desire, sex, marriage, adultery, kisses, or erotic attachment. |
| `coded` | The relation is suggested through euphemism, fascination, jealousy, intense intimacy, repeated symbolic language, or historical codes. |
| `rumor` | The relation mainly exists as gossip, scandal, accusation, reputation, blackmail, or public suspicion. |
| `weak_inference` | A queer or romantic reading is possible but fragile. Use sparingly. |
| `unclear` | The degree of explicitness cannot be determined. |

## 3. `centrality`

One label only.

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| `main` | The relationship is central to the novel, the protagonist's trajectory, or the main plot. |
| `secondary` | The relationship is an important subplot or affects the main characters, but is not the main relation. |
| `episode` | A brief adventure, temptation, encounter, confession, memory, or scene. |
| `milieu` | A background element of a social world: salon, brothel, convent, boarding school, decadent circle, theater, etc. |
| `unclear` | Centrality cannot be determined. |

## 4. `framing`

One dominant label only. If two framings are plausible, choose the dominant one and explain the secondary one in `comment`.

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| `positive` | The relation is presented as love, solidarity, attachment, care, mutual recognition, or a livable bond. |
| `neutral_ambivalent` | The relation is neither clearly condemned nor clearly valorized, or the judgment remains mixed. |
| `eroticized_exoticized` | The relation is framed as spectacle, sensual curiosity, voyeuristic scene, exotic setting, or erotic ornament. |
| `decadent_sublime` | The relation is morbid, painful, sacrificial, sacred, aestheticized, feverish, cruel, or sublime, without being reducible to moral condemnation or medical pathology. This was added after the pilot annotation of Renée Vivien's *Une femme m'apparut*. |
| `redemptive_spiritualized` | The relation is framed as salvation, spiritual refuge, healing, purification, compassion, or quasi-religious rescue. |
| `moralized_pathologized` | The relation is associated with vice, sin, degeneration, illness, hysteria, perversion, crime, or moral decline. |
| `comic_caricatural` | The relation or character is framed as ridiculous, grotesque, satirical, or comic. |
| `predatory_or_corrupting` | The relation is framed as emprise, manipulation, initiation into vice, corruption, coercion, or predation. |
| `unclear` | The dominant framing cannot be determined. |

## 5. `outcome`

One label only.

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| `stable_or_open` | The relation continues, remains possible, or is not narratively destroyed. |
| `open_contested` | The ending is suspended, disputed, reopened, or undecidable; rival relations or unresolved attachments remain active. This was added after the pilot annotation of *Une femme m'apparut*. |
| `return_to_norm` | Return to marriage, heterosexuality, family order, social respectability, or normative domesticity. |
| `separation_erasure` | The relation ends through separation, disappearance, forgetting, narrative marginalization, or erasure. |
| `social_disgrace` | The relation leads to scandal, reputational ruin, exclusion, blackmail, or public shame. |
| `illness_madness_decline` | The relation is followed by illness, madness, physical decline, moral degradation, or psychological collapse. |
| `fatal_ending` | The relation is followed by a fatal narrative resolution affecting one or more central characters. |
| `unclear` | Outcome cannot be determined. |

## Evidence

The model must provide 1 to 3 pieces of short evidence. Prefer brief paraphrases with chapter/page/section if available. Avoid long quotations. Evidence should support the closed labels, not offer free interpretation.

## Confidence

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| `high` | Several convergent textual cues; little doubt. |
| `medium` | Plausible and supported, but some interpretive ambiguity remains. |
| `low` | Fragile; useful for review but not for conservative statistics. |
| `exclude` | The candidate should probably not be counted as an annotated relationship. |

## Recommended analysis strategy

Run two analyses:

1. **Broad**: include `high`, `medium`, and perhaps `low` cases.
2. **Conservative**: include only `high` and `medium`, and exclude `weak_inference` unless manually validated.

For publication, report which analysis is primary and which is robustness checking.
